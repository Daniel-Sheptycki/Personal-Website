            paragraph: "The physical education program at my high school struggled with a manual system for student enrollment and activity scheduling. Teachers relied on paper forms and spreadsheets, which made the process inefficient and tedious. To solve this, I developed a full stack web application. The system allows teachers to manage student data, create activity blocks, update grades, download attendance PDF's and organize schedules with ease. Students can log in, select preferred activities, and view their schedules, all in one centralized platform.",

I utilized firebase as my backend as it's cloud-based, so the program could live on long after i graduate. I collaborated tightly with the phys-ed department as they were my clients, showing demos and reflecting desired changes. I exercised client relationships, communication, problem solving and time management. This resulted in a interface that is intuitive for both teachers and students.",

Teachers no longer manually assign students, and students enjoy a smooth experience selecting their activities. The system is accessible from any device and is scalable enough to expand to other departments. By replacing outdated methods with a modern, efficient solution, this project demonstrates how technology can streamline education and improve day-to-day operations in a real-world setting. I was awarded the MB Tech Week 2025 Scholarship Award for this project.",

            paragraph: "In the world of investing, accessing company information is easy, but navigating it is a different story. Most tools overwhelm users with raw information, requiring manual sifting or Excel expertise just to find what your looking for. To address this, I developed Fundementa, a web application that simplifies fundamental analysis. Users can search companies by ticker and instantly view a custom dashboard of information. They can also favorite key data points for quicker reference, save tickers for future access, and even create custom fields, such as “assets - liabilities” to calculate equity in real-time.",

The app integrates with a financial API to dynamically fetch company data. Although I was the sole developer, I collaborated with my brother to shape the app’s functionality and improve usability. This project deepened my experience with API integration, user account management, and custom data modeling, while also strengthening my skills in collaboration and iterative design.",

Unlike traditional spreadsheets or data-heavy platforms, users can quickly zero in on what matters to them. Investors with varying levels of experience can now access company information without needing to build out complex Excel models. The feedback from testers has been overwhelmingly positive, and the tool is already proving helpful in simplifying investment research. This project demonstrates how thoughtful design and smart tooling can make powerful data more approachable.",
